- 👋 Hi, I’m @advait-valluri
- 👀 I’m interested in learning basics of coding. I can't really code because I am a strategist and business development specialist, with a strong technical background
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some capabilities in MATLAB and LaTeX
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on general tips and tricks
- 📫 How to reach me: hit me up on advait.valluri@rwth-aachen.de
- 😄 Pronouns: I find this to be a sham. So it's Me/Myself
- ⚡ Fun fact: I played for a death metal band in the past
